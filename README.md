# Game Engine Template

This is an unfinished game engine template project developed in C++. I created this way back in 2010, but decided to re-upload it in case I ever decide to play with it again. (I lost my old github account from back then)

## Overview

The Game Engine Template project is designed to provide a basic structure for a game engine, utilizing Direct3D for graphics rendering, and includes foundational classes for handling various game engine components such as input, graphics, fonts, sprites, and system management.

## Features

- **Direct3D Integration**: Basic setup for Direct3D rendering.
- **Input Handling**: Capture and process user input.
- **Graphics Management**: Handle and render game graphics.
- **Font Rendering**: Basic font rendering capabilities.
- **Sprite Management**: Manage and render 2D sprites.
- **Game Loop**: Basic game loop structure to manage game updates and rendering.
- **Timer Class**: Simple timing class for frame rate control and other time-based operations.

## Project Structure

The project includes several classes that are essential for a game engine:

- **D3DClass**: Manages Direct3D initialization and rendering.
- **FontClass**: Handles font rendering.
- **GameClass**: The core game logic.
- **GraphicsClass**: Manages all graphics-related operations.
- **InputClass**: Captures and processes user input.
- **PlayerClass**: Basic player management.
- **SpriteClass**: Manages 2D sprites.
- **SystemClass**: Handles the system-level operations such as window creation and message processing.
- **TimerClass**: Manages time-related functions.

## Getting Started

To explore this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `Game Engine.sln` solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

## Contributing

I'm probably not even gonna look at pull requests.  This is basically an archive of my first dive in to c++ 14 years ago.
